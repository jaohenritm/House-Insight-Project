![alt text](https://github.com/jaohenritm/House-Insights-Project/blob/main/istockphoto-109350668-612x612.jpg?raw=true)

The objective of this project is to provide the business team of a fictitious company a recommendation of which houses avaiable in
a portfolio they should buy.

The visualization tool used in this project is the Streamlit, which can enable the company to visualize this result graphically,
use localization maps and tabulate.

The result achieved is a selection of **27 real estates** which corresponds only to 0.12% of the properties in the avaiable portfolio.
Assuming that the House Rocket would buy and sell all these properties with a price atleast 40% higher than they bought and estimating
that the company would spend atleast 10% of the total value of the house in reforms, we should expect a maximum profit of **$3,305,195.39 dollars**.

| **Total of Properties** | **Total Cost** | **Total Revenue** | **Profit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 27 | $11,017,318.00| $15,424,245.20 | $3,305,195.39

## 1. House Rocket

### 1.1 Business Context
House Rocket is a company whose business model is the purchase, renovating and sale of real estate.
The purpose of the case is to provide insights for the company to find the best business opportunities in the real estate market.

Their main strategy is to buy potential good homes that needs some renovation and then later resell them at higher prices.
The greater the difference between the purchase and the reform of the sale value, better will be their profit.

Our objective is to analyse which attributes play the main role of affecting the house prices and what the company should do
with them.

### 1.2 Motivation behing this Project
Considering that:

a) The business team can't take good decisions without analysing the data, and;
b) The portfolio is too large, which it would take a lot of time to do it manually.

The main goal of this project is to use the abilities and tools of the Data Science 
to make a selection with the best real estates opportunities that will provide the maximum profit for the company.

- Which real estates that House Rocket should purchase?
- Once the house is purchased, when is the best time to sell it and at what price?
